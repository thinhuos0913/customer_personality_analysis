# Problem Statement
Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. 
For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the companyâ€™s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
# Target
Need to perform clustering to summarize customer segmentation.
